# guessing-game-express

Welcome to another iteration of the Guessing Game. This version will be implemented with
Express framework.

On top of using Express, I have introduced the use of ESlint and Prettier, in an attempt
to improve my code style and format.

## Important Updates

This version will be converted to use MongoDB Atlas, their new Cloud Platform.

## Focuses this iteration

### Mobile First Development

is the idea where the designer designs for the most difficult screens to work with (ie Mobile because of small screen size), and will use media queries to handle (add CSS) larger screens from there.

Mobile First Development promotes focus on the content. The content is what websites were made for and by focusing on the content leads to more organic styles.

Along with Mobile First Development I have also been trying to understand **_Color Theory_** and the effects color has on people and content.
I am tired of creating boring applications with subpar UI. I am taking this opportunity to learn from examples I have seen online and by reading articles on Design.
