# guessing-game-express

Welcome to another iteration of the Guessing Game. This version will be implemented with the Express framework.

On top of using Express, I have introduced the use of ESlint and Prettier, in an attempt to improve my code format.

## Important Updates

This version will be converted to use MongoDB Atlas, their new Cloud Platform.

## Focuses this iteration

### Mobile First Development

The idea where the designer designs for the most difficult screens to work with (ie Mobile because of small screen size), and will use media queries to handle (add CSS) larger screens from there.

Mobile First Development promotes focus on the content. The content is what websites were made for and it is important to provide a good experience for users despite screen size.

Along with Mobile First Development I have also been trying to understand Color Theory and the effects color has on the content and its readers.

I am taking this opportunity to learn from examples I have seen online and by reading articles on Design.
